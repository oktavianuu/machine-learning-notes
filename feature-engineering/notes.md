## The Goal of Feature Engineering
- improve a model's predictive performance
- reduce computational or data needs
- improve interpretability of the results

### Principle of Feature Engineering
A feature is said to be useful when it has a relationship with its target variable so our model will be able to learn from that relationship. For example, linear models are only able to learn linear relationships.

#### Example - Concrete Formualations
